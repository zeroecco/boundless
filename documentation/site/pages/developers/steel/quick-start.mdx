# Getting Started with Steel

The recommended place is to start is [Steel examples](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/tree/main/examples), specifically the [ERC20 Counter](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/tree/main/examples/erc20-counter) example.

The [create-steel-app](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/tree/main/crates/steel/docs/create-steel-app) script will allow you to set up the erc20-counter example locally in one command:

```bash
sh <(curl -fsSL https://getsteel.xyz)
```

This example acts as your skeleton project structure for further development. Once the script is finished, you can run through a test workflow with either local proving or Bonsai proving.

Further Steel documentation will guide you through the [ERC20-counter example](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/tree/main/examples/erc20-counter) as a guide to explain Steel in detail.
