## Default: Merkle Inclusion Proofs

By default, Boundless delivers proofs on-chain as merkle inclusion proofs:

1. Proofs are batched together are aggregated into a single Groth16 proof.
2. The aggregated proof is verified once on-chain
3. Individual proofs are verified through cheap merkle inclusion proofs into this root

This design is what makes Boundless cost-effective for on-chain verification.

## Requesting a specific proof type

While merkle inclusion proofs are efficient for on-chain verification, there may be cases where you need to access the underlying proof instead of a merkle inclusion proof. For example:

1. Cross-chain verification where you need to verify the proof on a different chain
2. Integration with other systems that expect a specific proof type
3. Custom verification logic that requires the full proof

Boundless supports requesting a raw Groth16 proof instead of a merkle inclusion proof. You can specify this in your proof request by setting the `proof_type` to `ProofType::Groth16`:

# use alloy_primitives::utils::parse_ether;
# use boundless_market::contracts::{Offer, Predicate, ProofRequest, Requirements};
# use risc0_zkvm::sha::{Digest, Digestible};
# use url::Url;
# let image_url = Url::parse("https://example.com/image").unwrap();
# let input_url = Url::parse("https://example.com/input").unwrap();
# let ECHO_ID = Digest::default();
# let journal: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
# let mcycles_count: u64 = 1000;

let request = ProofRequest::builder()
    .with_image_url(image_url)
    .with_input(input_url)
    .with_requirements(
        Requirements::new(ECHO_ID, Predicate::digest_match(journal.digest()))
            .with_groth16_proof(),  // Request raw Groth16 proof
    )
    .with_offer(
        Offer::default()
            .with_min_price_per_mcycle(parse_ether("0.001")?, mcycles_count)
            .with_max_price_per_mcycle(parse_ether("0.002")?, mcycles_count)
            .with_timeout(1000)
            .with_lock_timeout(1000),
    )
    .build()?;
# Ok(())
# })().unwrap();
```

## Considerations

When choosing between proof types, consider:

1. **Gas Costs**
   - Merkle inclusion proofs are much cheaper to verify on-chain
   - Raw Groth16 proofs require full SNARK verification each time. This will increase the price of the proof

2. **Use Case Requirements**
   - If you only need on-chain verification, use the default merkle inclusion proof
   - If you need cross-chain verification or raw proof data, use Groth16
   - If you need to compose the proof by verifying it within another zkVM guest program, use Groth16

## Example: Proof Composition using Proof Types

In the [Proof Composition example](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/tree/main/examples/proof-composition), we demonstrate how to compose a proof from multiple proofs.

Composing a proof requires us to verify a previously generated Groth16 proof within the zkVM guest program. This requires us to request a raw Groth16 proof from the Boundless Market.


In the composition example, we first request a raw Groth16 proof from the Boundless Market using the `ECHO` guest program.

# use alloy::primitives::utils::parse_ether;
# use boundless_market::contracts::{Offer, Predicate, ProofRequest, Requirements};
# use risc0_zkvm::sha::{Digest, Digestible};
# use url::Url;
# (|| -> anyhow::Result<()> {
# let image_url = Url::parse("https://example.com/image").unwrap();
# let input_url = Url::parse("https://example.com/input").unwrap();
# let ECHO_ID = Digest::default();
# let journal: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
# let mcycles_count = 1;
let request = ProofRequest::builder()
    .with_image_url(image_url)
    .with_input(input_url)
    .with_requirements(                                                       // [!code focus]
        Requirements::new(ECHO_ID, Predicate::digest_match(journal.digest())) // [!code focus]
            .with_groth16_proof(),  // Request raw Groth16 proof                 [!code focus]
    )                                                                         // [!code focus]
    .with_offer(
        Offer::default()
            .with_min_price_per_mcycle(parse_ether("0.001")?, mcycles_count)
            .with_max_price_per_mcycle(parse_ether("0.002")?, mcycles_count)
            .with_timeout(1000)
            .with_lock_timeout(1000),
    )
    .build()?;
# Ok(())
# })().unwrap();
```

We then provide the Groth16 proof as input to the `IDENTITY` zkVM guest program, and verify the proof.

```rust
use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
use risc0_zkvm::{Digest, Receipt};

fn main() {
    let (image_id, receipt): (Digest, Receipt) = env::read();
    let claim = receipt.claim().unwrap();
    receipt.verify(image_id).unwrap();
    ....
}
```
