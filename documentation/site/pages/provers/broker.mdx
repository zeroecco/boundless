# Broker Configuration & Operation

## Overview

The Broker is a service that runs within the [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) proving stack. It is responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain.

## Broker Configuration

:::tip[Tip]
Broker will live-reload the `broker.toml` when it changes. In most cases, you will not need to restart the Broker for the configuration to take effect.
:::

Broker configuration is primarily managed through the `broker.toml` file in the Boundless directory. This file is mounted into the Broker container and it is used to configure the Broker daemon.

### Deposit / Balance

The Boundless market requires funds (USDC) deposited as stake before a prover can bid on requests.
Brokers must first deposit some USDC into the market contract to fund their account.
These funds cover staking during lock-in.
It is recommend that a broker keep a balance on the market >= `max_stake` (configured via broker.toml).

#### Deposit Stake to the Market

:::note[Note]
You will need the Boundless CLI installed to deposit/check your balance.
Please see [Installing the Boundless CLI](/developers/tooling/cli#installation) for instructions.
:::

```bash [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
# Use the env file based on the network you are connecting to
source .env.eth-sepolia

# Example: 'account deposit-stake 100'
boundless account deposit-stake <USDC_TO_DEPOSIT>
```

#### Check Current Stake Balance

```bash [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
# Use the env file based on the network you are connecting to
source .env.eth-sepolia

boundless account stake-balance [wallet_address]
```

You can omit the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable here and specify your `wallet_address` as a optional parameter to the `balance` command, i.e., `account balance 0x000....`

### Settings in Broker.toml

:::tip[See all broker.toml settings]
To see all the possible settings in `broker.toml`, please refer to [broker-template.toml](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/broker-template.toml) in the Boundless monorepo.
:::

:::warning[Warning]
Quotation marks matter in TOML so please pay particular attention to the quotation marks for config values.

Below are some `broker.toml` settings:

| setting                  | initial value | description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mcycle\_price            | `".001"`      | The price (in native token of target market) of proving 1M cycles.                                             |
| assumption\_price        | `"0.1"`       | Currently unused.                                                                                              |
| peak\_prove\_khz         | `500`         | This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate - see [Benchmarking Bento](#benchmarking-bento). |
| min\_deadline            | `150`         | This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job. |
| lookback\_blocks         | `100`         | This is used on Broker initialization, and sets the number of blocks to look back for candidate proofs.        |
| max\_stake               | `"0.5"`       | The maximum amount used to lock in a job for any single order.                                                 |
| skip\_preflight\_ids     | `[]`          | A list of `imageID`s that the Broker should skip preflight checks in format `["0xID1","0xID2"]`.               |

```

### Benchmarking Bento

Load environment variables for the target network:

```bash [Terminal]
# For example, to benchmark an order on Ethereum Sepolia
source .env.eth-sepolia

# Load any other relevant env variables here, specifically `RPC_URL` and postgres env (if not default)
```

Start a bento cluster:

```bash [Terminal]
just bento
```

Then, run the benchmark:

```bash [Terminal]
boundless proving benchmark --request-ids <IDS>
```

where IDS is a comma-separated list of request IDs from the network or order stream configured.

It is recommended to pick a few requests of varying sizes and programs, biased towards larger proofs for a more representative benchmark.

To run programs manually, and for performance optimizations, see [performance optimizations](/provers/performance-optimization).

### Running the Broker service with bento

Running a broker with `just` will also start the Bento cluster through docker compose.

:::note[Note]
`just` installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
:::

```bash [Terminal]
just broker
```

### Make sure Bento is running

:::warning[Warning]
A Broker needs a [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) instance to operate. Please follow the [quick start](/provers/quick-start) guide to get Bento up and running.
:::

To check Bento is running correctly, you can send a sample proof workload:

> Before running this, [install Bento CLI](/provers/quick-start#running-a-test-proof)

```bash [Terminal]
# In the bento directory
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 32
```

### Running a standalone broker

To run broker with an already initialized Bento cluster or with a different prover, you can build and run a broker directly with the following:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo build --bin broker --release
# Run with flags or environment variables based on network/configuration
./target/release/broker
```

### Stopping The Broker Service

```bash [Terminal]
just broker down
```

:::warning[Warning]
If running the broker on a network, there may be locked proofs that have not been fulfilled yet. Follow the [Safe Upgrade Steps](#safe-upgrade-steps) to ensure shutdown and/or restart without loss of stake.
:::

## Safe Upgrade Steps

:::warning[Breaking Changes]
There can be subtle breaking changes between releases that may affect your broker's state. Following these upgrade steps helps minimize issues from state breaking changes.
:::

When upgrading your Boundless broker to a new version, follow these steps to ensure a safe migration:

::::steps

##### Stop the broker and optionally clean the database

```bash [Terminal]
just broker clean

# Or stop the broker without clearing volumes
just broker down
```

This will wait for any committed orders to finalize before shutting down. Avoid sending kill signals to the broker process and ensure either through the broker logs or through indexer that your broker does not have any incomplete locked orders before proceeding.

:::note[Database Cleanup]
While it is generally not necessary to clear volumes unless specifically noted in release, it is recommended to avoid any potential state breaking changes.
:::

##### Update to the new version

See [releases](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/releases) for latest tag to use.

```bash [Terminal]
git checkout <new_version_tag>
# Example: git checkout v0.9.0
```

##### Start the broker with the new version

```bash [Terminal]
just broker
```

::::

## Running Multiple Brokers

You can run multiple broker instances simultaneously to serve different networks at the same time while sharing the same Bento cluster. The Docker compose setup supports this through the `broker2` service example.

### Multi-Broker Configuration

Each broker instance requires:

1. **Separate configuration file**: Create different `broker.toml` files (e.g., `broker.toml`, `broker2.toml`, etc.)
2. **Different RPC URL**: Use different chain endpoints via setting respective `RPC_URL` environment variables, or modifying the `compose.yml` manually.
3. **Optional separate private key**: Use different `PRIVATE_KEY` variables if desired for different accounts on different networks.

### Environment Variables for Multi-Broker Setup

If using the default `compose.yml` file and uncommenting the second broker config:

```bash [.env]
# Export environment variables for the first broker
export RPC_URL=<URL for network 1>
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Export environment variables for the second broker
export RPC_URL_2=<URL for network 2>
```

Then, create the new broker config file that the second broker will use:

```bash [Terminal]
# Copy from an existing broker config file
cp broker.toml broker2.toml

# Or creating one from a fresh template
cp broker-template.toml broker2.toml
```

Then, modify configuation values for each network, keeping the following in mind:

- The `peak_prove_khz` setting is shared across all brokers
  - For example, if you have [benchmarked](#benchmarking-bento) your broker to be able to prove at 500kHz, the values in each config should not sum up to be more than 500kHz.
- `max_concurrent_preflights` is set to a value that the bento cluster can keep up with
  - It is recommended that the max concurrent preflights across all networks is less than the number of exec agents you have specified in your `compose.yml`.
- `max_concurrent_proofs` is a per-broker configuration, and is not shared across brokers

Then, just start the cluster as you normally would with:

```bash [Terminal]
just broker
```

## Broker Optimization

### Increasing Lock-in Rate

Once your broker is running, there are a few methods to optimize the lock-in rate. These methods are aimed at making your broker service more competitive in the market through different means:

1. Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would tune your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs.
2. Increasing `lockin_priority_gas` expedites your market operations by consuming more gas which could help outrun other bidders.

### Tuning Service Settings

The `[prover]` settings in `broker.toml` are used to configure the prover service and significantly impact the operation of the service. The most important configuration variable to monitor and iteratively tune is `txn_timeout`. This is the number of seconds to wait for a transaction to be confirmed before timing out. Therefore, if you see timeouts in your logs, `txn_timeout` can be increased to wait longer for transaction confirmations onchain.
