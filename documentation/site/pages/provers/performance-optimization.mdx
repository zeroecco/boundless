# Performance Optimization

:::tip[Tip]
Bento performance is tightly coupled to the specific environment, equipment, and compute provider's requirements. Recommendations in this guide should be used as reference rather than a concrete recommendation on configuration.
:::

## Recommended Tools

We recommend the following tools to monitor performance and resource use:

- [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) - A tool to monitor GPU utilization.
- [htop](https://htop.dev) - A tool to monitor CPU utilization, system memory, and process status.

Both of these tools warrant a decent size terminal window on your desktop to monitor the performance during experiments.

## Build Configuration

The `NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS` Docker build arg (found in `compose.yml -> services -> exec_agent -> build -> args`) should be set to match your specific GPU architecture, a good reference for GPU -> SM version can be [found here](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards).

You can also adjust the CUDA optimization level via `CUDA_OPT_LEVEL` in the `exec_agent` build args. A value of `3` might yield slightly better performance (a few %) but at the cost of much longer build times.

## Testing

### Isolating Tests

Operating competing workloads can lead to unpredictable results. We recommend isolating your test system from other workloads to ensure that the performance tuning results are consistent and reliable. This includes stopping configured [Broker](/provers/broker#stopping-the-broker-service) services:

```sh [Terminal]
docker ps
docker stop <BROKER_CONTAINER_ID>
```

Alternatively you can start Bento without running the broker service:

```sh [Terminal]
just bento
```

### Defining a Test Harness

It is recommended to benchmark using an example of your actual workload. Using a representative workload will provide more accurate turn around times, and validate your program and inputs file for the proofs you plan to generate.

> Before running this, [install Bento CLI](/provers/quick-start#bento-cli-installation)

To try a realistic example:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -f /path/to/program -i /path/to/input`
```

If you intend to operate across a variety of different workloads (such as those that may be fed by the [Broker](/provers/broker)), you can also use the following command to generate a synthetic workload:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c <ITERATION_COUNT>
```

where `<ITERATION_COUNT>` is the number of times the synthetic guest is executed. A value of 4096 is a good starting point, however on smaller or less performant hosts, you may want to reduce this to 2048 or 1024 while performing some of your experiments. For functional testing, 32 is sufficient.

The typical test process will be:

1. Start `nvtop` and `htop`
2. Execute the test harness above and copy the job id
3. Upon completion of the job use the [`script/job_status.sh`](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/scripts/job_status.sh) to view the results

#### Example test run of 1024 iterations:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 1024
```

In the final table, the effective Hz is the primary metric for consideration. This represents the (number of cycles) / (elapsed wallclock time). In the example above, the effective Hz is roughly 400kHz.

:::tip[Note]
In the `job_status.sh` output above, the Hz is only accurate if the job has completed with no error conditions. Failed and in-progress jobs will have an inflated Hz value.

## Finding the Maximum `SEGMENT_SIZE` for GPU VRAM

We will start by optimizing the GPU workers. This is because the bulk of the RISC Zero workload is executed by the `gpu-agent` and GPU resources are most often the performance bottleneck.

### What is the Segment Size?

An important concept to understand for testing is [RISC Zero's continuations](https://dev.risczero.com/api/recursion). Continuations are the key mechanism that allow RISC Zero's zkVM to scale to effectively handle arbitrarily large proofs.

The CPU first runs the workload in a pre-flight stage where it doesn't engage in proving, while doing so it divides the program trace into a series of [segments](https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#segment). In Bento ,these segments are then dispatched to various workers for proving, and are combined back together in the final stage to produce the proof.

The key tuning parameter of continuations is `SEGMENT_SIZE` in the `.env.broker` file. A proof is divided into `(2^SEGMENT_SIZE)` sized segments. The default value is 20, which means that a proof is composed of the number of required segments of approximately 1M cycles `(2^20 = 1048576)`.

`SEGMENT_SIZE has` some practical implications, related to GPU VRAM capacity. Below is a set of guidelines for setting `SEGMENT_SIZE` maximums:

| VRAM | `SEGMENT_SIZE` Max |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 8GB  | 19                 |
| 16GB | 20                 |
| 20GB | 21                 |

### Testing the GPU has enough memory to handle the Segment Size

:::tip[Note]
Boundless should be restarted upon changing the `SEGMENT_SIZE` value, and verify that [Broker](/provers/broker#stopping-the-broker-service) is not running.
:::

Once you have selected a `MAXIMUM` segment size you should verify that the GPU does in fact have enough memory to complete.

In the following test, an RTX 4060 with 16GB VRAM attempts to run with a `SEGMENT_SIZE` of 21, which is too large for the GPU to handle. In this test, it is necessary to monitor the `gpu-agent` Docker logs to determine the cause of the failure.

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 4096
```

```txt [Terminal]
2024-10-17T15:58:15.205138Z  INFO bento_cli: image_id: a0dfc25e54ebde808e4fd8c34b6549bbb91b4928edeea90ceb7d1d8e7e9096c7 | input_id: fe7f4251-25f4-436f-b782-f134d4c80538

2024-10-17T15:58:15.211686Z  INFO bento_cli: STARK Job running....
....
```

We then examine the `gpu-agent` logs and see a series of out of memory errors:

```sh [Terminal]
docker logs bento-gpu_prove_agent0-1
```

```log [Terminal]
2024-10-17T15:57:43.667484Z  INFO workflow::tasks::prove: Starting proof of idx: 6f95e238-d0be-4e94-9e81-fefdc0b7d8c4 - 1

```

Indicating that the GPU is out of memory. In this case, the `SEGMENT_SIZE` should be reduced.

:::tip[Note]
If you have a multi-GPU system, your `SEGMENT_SIZE` should be set to the lowest common denominator of the GPUs in the system, so benchmarking should be performed on that card by tuning device-id in `compose.yml`.
:::

:::tip[Note]
If a job fails to complete due to OOM, it may be resumed after Bento has been restarted. It's important to ensure that resumed jobs are not in progress during the test harness execution.

## How to Benchmark an Individual GPU's `SEGMENT_SIZE`

::::steps

#### Configure a Single GPU Instance

```yml [compose.yml]
gpu_agent0: &gpu
    image: agent
    runtime: nvidia
    pull_policy: never
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
      - minio

    mem_limit: 4G
    cpu_count: 4
```

#### Verify that No Other GPU Definitions Are Present in the Compose File

#### Confirm the `SEGMENT_SIZE` Is Set to the Maximum as Determined Above in the `.env.broker` File

#### Execute the Test Harness

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 4096
```

#### Confirm Single GPU Utilization Using `nvtop`

> Monitoring Bento with [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop)
![Nvtop diagram](/nvtop.png)


#### Review the Effective Hz

```sh [Terminal]
bash scripts/job_status.sh <JOB_ID>
```

```txt [Example Results]
....

Effective Hz:
         hz          | total_cycles | elapsed_sec
---------------------+--------------+-------------
 264892.074666431500 | 34603008     |  130.630590
(1 row)
```

Here we see that our single `gpu-agent` at max `SEGMENT_SIZE` is able to achieve an effective 264kHz.

::::

## Multiple Agents and GPUs

We can incorporate multiple GPUs into a configuration. In this example, we have two 16GB GPU as that proved to be optimal above:

```yml [compose.yml]
....
  gpu_agent0: &gpu
    image: agent
    runtime: nvidia
    pull_policy: never
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
      - minio
....
  gpu_agent1:
     <<: *gpu

     deploy:
       resources:
         reservations:
           devices:
             - driver: nvidia
               device_ids: ['0']
               capabilities: [gpu]

  gpu_agent2:
     <<: *gpu

     deploy:
       resources:
         reservations:
           devices:
             - driver: nvidia
               device_ids: ['1']
               capabilities: [gpu]

  gpu_agent3:
     <<: *gpu

     deploy:
       resources:
         reservations:
           devices:
             - driver: nvidia
               device_ids: ['1']
               capabilities: [gpu]
....
```

Here are the effective results on our example system:

```txt [Terminal]
431375.207834042771 | 35127296     |   81.430957
```

In this case, we see that the effective Hz has increased to 431kHz, which is a significant improvement over the single GPU configuration; however we anticipated if the system was GPU limited we could expect 264Hz \* 2 = 528Hz.

This means that our example system is bound by some other factor such as bus bandwidth, memory, etc.

Some further suggestions:

- Reconfigure the system back to higher `PO2` with single agent per GPU and establish a new baseline performance level to compare against.
- For lower `SEGMENT_SIZE` configurations, experiment with `cpu_count` and `mem_limit` (removing, increasing, or decreasing) to see if the performance can be improved.
- In cases where bus contention is the limiting factor, running fewer agents at higher maximum `SEGMENT_SIZE` may be optimal. Systems in this configuration should avoid GPU expansion, and instead opt to expand into remote workers.
